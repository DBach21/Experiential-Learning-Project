# Tableau-Experiential-Learning-Project
IoT power monitoring project with Exempler LLC
     The purpose of the experiential learning opportunity with Exempler LLC was to create a series of visualizations utilizing their IoT power monitoring data. These visualizations are a foundational example of the views and types of information that potential supply chain and other industrial clients would be interested in: Namely those that have power monitoring needs in remote areas, as well as those in the shipping industry. 

     The data was originally loaded into Jupyter Notebook so as to use Python as an initial means of exploratory data analysis. Based upon the nature of the JSON data, it was determined that loading the file into Tableau and creating the visualizations from there would be the most appropriate. The ultimate views that are represented in the project include:

•	Pareto chart for sensor issues

•	Pie chart for power downs by day of the week

•	Stacked bar chart for power downs by hour of the day

•	Control chart for process monitoring with said sensors

•	Heat map to display density of power down issues

•	Geospatial analysis for shipping example
